## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Facebook Messenger - Ability to change photos in messager background
Facebook Messenger - Ability to change fonts and background color
Instagram - Ability to hash tag and delete old messages or have a "draft" safe to finish messages later
Crunchyroll - Ability to choose subtitles and language played on video
Youtube - Ability to play with subtitles and selecting possible better resolution

I would like to have the ability to select language audio prior to playing a video and also select what subtitles to play prior to playing a video (whether on YouTube or Crunchroll both have it but after playing the video not before as a filter). Currently all outlets always have it as an option after selecting the video. Having a filter would make it more expedited although it maybe hard to execute. I find that this simple option would help everyone, just like when you set up a computer it initially asks what language you want to use.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The problems I encountered were that the pre-work instructions were very vague and not really as intuitive as it seeemed. I did a lot of researching on my own to figure out the steps when a simple screenshot could of resolved a lot of problems as the guides and reviews covered more code but not the overall functionality of xCode.
